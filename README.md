# Map-Visualization-in-R
This exercise is to visualize real geographical maps in R and then classify it by states or counties. We also can continue to build more on the same as we progress with map building, with other possible variations.

The above link is what taught me the map method and I am working on it to reproduce the results and build more on the features.
